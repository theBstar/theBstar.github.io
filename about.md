## Glad you're here!

Hi, I am Bikram. A biologist turned software engineer. I am from Tezpur, Assam. Currently living in Bangalore.

I am a natural introvert. But I have cracked the formula for floating around that line between introvert and extrovert. 

Call me for a game of cricket or a run, I am always ready. Party, Movies, Travel? Let me think...


I specialize in web development. I would love to work on any interesting (or challenging, that's what they say) engineering problem in any domain and stack.

### I have worked on
  - Javascript
  - Typescript
  - React
  - Mithril
  - Meteor
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Graphql
  - Python
  - C
  - Flutter
  - Java
