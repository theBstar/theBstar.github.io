Hey, Finally I ticked one box out of many for this year.

I am playing BSL8. It's a community organised leather ball tournament. So I can tick one box off from my list for 2020.

This month, I have been regularly running from my office to home, apart from a few rest days here and there.

I am doing good with my job. Learning lot of new things in my free time, Basically in the evenings. I updated my [react-switch-theme][NPMLINK] npm package. Made it more usable and beginner friendly. Also did some code restructuring and cleaning. Contributed to react-mention documentation. Open-source contribution really feels good.

I am still working on keeping my energy up for the Google web specialist exam. 

See you on the other side of the month!
