June is pretty eventful. This is the month where I am constantly checking myself. Frequently questioning my to-dos and doing.

It all started from me not attending Amazons interview. Yes, I got an interview invitation which involved an online assesment. After a few days of introspection, I have decided to not continue with the interview. I always wanted to create something which is useful for people and also gives me the sense of ownership. Although I am getting the sense of ownership at Radicali, I want to work on something of my own.

I am from Assam. That part of the country is way beyond other developed states in India in terms of technical development. I want to take technology there. It is a real big and open market if you see from bussiness prospective. Most of current solutions are focusing on metro and tier 1 cities. Lives in other places is still manual and hard at times. I would love contribute to these tier 2 & 3 cities or villages.

If that is my real calling then why am I working here in Bangalore? A hard question, so many factors are involved in this. Top one would be the financial health of me and my family. But now, I think I am almost there. I don't have a runway of even a month, but the family is in a situation that even I don't contribute financailly, it won't wobble. 

So, this is it. This is the time I move on. This is the time I start. And to my surprise, I got a call from a person (from Assam) yesterday night. Our visions are more or less same. I am going to take the conversation forward. Lets see how it goes. But however it goes, this is the time I start. Either I start with that guy or on my own. I am going to communicate this to my CTO today on our 1-O-1 and start working towards my exit. 

I will write a month summary later. Also, I am going to update on my plan later. But in short, I am returning to Assam!

Stay safe!
