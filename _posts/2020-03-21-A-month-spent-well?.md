When People were practicing social distancing to stop the spread of Corona virus, we were travelling the south Indian temples and tourist places. Everything was planned and tickets were booked a long time ago. Corona virus was not a thing back then, not even when my parents ended-up in Bangalore. We visted Mysore, Ooty, Madurai, Kanyakumari, Rameswaram, Trichy, Tirupathi and many other places along the way. We had lot of fun and Most importantly, everyone is safe.

Being an Aethist, watching people doing crazy things was really funny. At the same time the joy I saw at my parents face, made the trip the best one till date.

I will be reviewing my month in a different blog.
Stay happy, stay safe.
