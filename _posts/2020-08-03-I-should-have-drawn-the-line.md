While I was running after perfection time was running out too. I was preparing for google mobile web certifications. But I can't take the exam anymore because it has been stopped. ðŸ˜‘ . I should have drawn the line between perfection and time taken.

I had a plan to take the exam in Feb/March. But a few things hold me back. It was only from mid May I started seriously. And yesterday I had truned up to register for the exam and saw that it was not there. It had been stopped. I spent too much time running after perfection. I should have given a shoot earlier. Those were the thoughts coming into mind first. 

<!â€“-break-â€“>

I can try to justify the time I took, by saying that I just wanted myself to be completely ready. Also the exam fee was a concern. Because you get only once chance for a considerable amount of fee. You must pay the fee again to appear. I wanted to crack it in the first go. But even then, there were times, when I felt I should do it now! Being a bit rusty could have been better.

Okay. I gotta work on some serious projects now. I will remove the certification from my goal list and add a new goal.
I have a few projects in my mind. I will continue doing projects. Each completing in 45 days. Mosly in vanilajs or in a new framework or tech which I don't know or not well versed with yet. I will write a blog summarising the learnigs and takeways after the month end. 

As I always like to say, Today is the best day to start. 

Stay safe!
