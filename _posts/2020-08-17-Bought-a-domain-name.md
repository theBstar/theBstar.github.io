I bought a domain name a few days ago. I am planning to create a nice portfolio like landing page. This blog will also be hosted on the same domain or in a sub domain on the same domain.

I mostly write about what is going on in my life and some of what is comming in this blog. I don't want this blog to be on the front. People can still read it but It is not the thing I am trying to sell. I will start working on the new site from this week. Meanwhile many other exciting things are happening in life. One of them has to be the driving lessons. I am starting with the practical sessions today. I will be acompanied by a driving instructor on road. I am bit nervous to be honest. Traffic don't really give me a good feeling. Hopefully by the end of these sessions I will get better.

I have been doing good with the technical pieces. I should definately get better at publishing frequently but the response so far has been good. The last blog I wrote was titled - Learn typescript in 15 minutes. Targeted towards developers doing more than what I expected. I have already got like 20 followers on medium. But above all these writings are good to improve myself and an opportunity to dig deep into internals as well. I haven't published in last two weeks! I should try to get one out each week.

Nothing much to update on the professional side. Last few weeks have been really busy. Couldn't focus well on the personal projects. I have been translating the javascript.info to Hindi. This was going well until a few weeks ago. Now, it has slowed down. I have to take out some time for this as well. I have been wasting sometime doing unnecessary introspections. I must cut down this time and backup my decissions. This is not a time to do introspections. Need to focus on the process more. I am one of the best at executions when I only focus on the process. So, for the next few weeks I am trying to cut down my time spent on introspections and some other random things and focus more on the my bigger plan. Deliverables are the website and a blog a week.
