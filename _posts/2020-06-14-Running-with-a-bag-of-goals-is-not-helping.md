I started the year with a lot of big plans. Corona runnied a few and I must accept, few were not planned well.

In this post I am trying to note down the learnings from the last 5 months. Also I am going to apply them to better manage my goals in coming days. I am lacking a bit here but high hopes for ticking of all boxes.

I ran into a similiar problem, doing many things at a same time. I was trying my hands on so many things again. Although I managed to tick of some of the boxes, I am not where I wanted to be in this time of the year. I did not manage my time well in last 4 months. 
When doing many things at the same time I tend to loose context. So, I am done with the switching. I am going to try just taking one task at a time from now.

Now comes the question of priorities. I had already set out my goals for the year and I pretty much aligned with that, I just re-ordered two items on the list. Item on top of the lsit is where my focus now. 

I always wanted to take the Google Mobile Web Certification exam. I am giving myself exactly 100 days from tomorrow to prepare for the exam. I am planning to update my progress on a daily basis, let see how it goes. Second thing on the list is a half marathon. I have same 100 days to prepare for it. With a buffer of a few days I am looking to tick both the boxes by September 28th 2020.

That is all for now. I will be updating daily on twitter.
Stay safe, stay hungry!
