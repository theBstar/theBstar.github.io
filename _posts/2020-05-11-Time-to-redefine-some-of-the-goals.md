It has been one of the hardest times I have ever faced. Everything is stopped. And many of those are affecting my timelines.

I must redefine some of my goals to be more realistic. I would be happy to complete google web-specialist certification and a half marathon by end of 2020.

After ivesting some time for my first two tech blogs and some drafts, I found that one tech blog a week may not be enough to produce good content. I am thinking of producing bi-weekly tech blog going forward.

I have been reading much on Js, You don't know Js is currently on my reading table. I have some on design patters and clean code stuffs. DSA and DOM would be the next things to deep dive in.
