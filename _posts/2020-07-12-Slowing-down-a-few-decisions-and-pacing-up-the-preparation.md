This month has been very busy. I made a few quick decisions. I still back them but the situation is screaming on me to slow down.

Maybe I need to slow down and make a more robust plan for returning to Assam. I am pretty much with the idea of going back with a job, exploring and trying out things over there. The only thing that worries me is how that will go? Will I be more relaxed? Maybe or maybe not. But there is no harm to go with a job. But If I am not able to focus for a month or so, I have to say goodbye to the job. Let's see. I am yet to make this decision. I will come to a conclusion by this week. Considering the current situation I don't see it happening in July. I am planning to move by early Sept. But It also depends on the corona cases and the weather in Assam.

Wow! Last few days have been very busy, as I said. I have been going through some of the resources for my cert preparation. It is going well. I on track or a bit advanced. Running has stopped. I was having serious calf pain, so I did not run at all last week. Will resume this week. 

What more? Oh, back to HackerEarth. Loose ~100 rating point from my first two contest. Did some silly mistake. Also, the compiler was really bad in the last contest. However, I have to up my game here. I will do some DSA practice every week on Thursday from this week. I have the goal to end with 1800 ratings or in top 50 by the year-end if you don't know.

And this is it. This week I am focusing on running a 7k and continue preparing for cert & some DSA. See you next week!

Stay safe!
