It has been almost 3 months since my parents are here. They are slowing getting used to this environment.

It was hard for them initially to fit in the city and the lockdown added fuel to the fire. Now, they are complaining a bit less, thanks to ramayana, mahabharata, sree krishna, and what not. They are on a roll. They love the shows and that eases out my day. They are busy with the shows and does not feel bore anymore. It allows me to work.

Now some introspection, I have been failing totally in keeping me fit. I have not published any technical blog in last two weeks. But, I have been doing well with my work. I have to start running, its been quite a while since last run.  I have been reading the YDKJS series 1. Its a large series with 6 books. 4s have been completed. It looks at JS from different prospective. I am planning to run through other 3 this week.

There have been a few challanges with managing a team. It is not easy to get best out of everyone. Also, I was struggling two weeks ago managing my development tasks and doing reviews, merges and discussion, doubt clear sessions. I went through some resources, got used to more context switching and getting better at this. My CTO has sent me out some resources. I am yet to go through all of them.

Plan for the week is to complete YDKJS series, there is yet another book to be completed on TS + Js which I am already half way through. I must start running or atleast start going out for a walk. I will also work on some of the drafts on medium to publish atleast one of them by next weekends.

Stay safe, stay hungry!
