Everything has been coming along nicely. I am moving to Assam today (Actually tomorrow), I have been a little busy this week. Last few weeks has been really good. Although I couldn't write much in this time. I am happy with the overall efforts.

I went for a few run. Set my best 5k and 10k time in 4-5 years. Hoping to carry on from here. I feel confident now of completing a half marathon by Dec.

Hacktober fest resulted in a few extra MRs in Javascript.info Hindi repo. Spent time reviewing them and raising issues. Lets see if anyone is resolving the issues. Love for a tshirst is evident. I also did a couple of open source contributions during this time. One of them is contributing to public lab.
