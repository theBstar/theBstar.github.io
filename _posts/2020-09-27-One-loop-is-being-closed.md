I could have tried and got a good govt job back in 2016. But I had other plans. Also, I was well assisted this time around to work on the plan. I was allowed to take some time, take some risk. And my journey started.

I was always fascinated by technologies. Was always interested in computers. When I was in class 9 or 10, I remember reading a book on the computer of my cousin. Well, I hadn't seen a computer at that time, It was only in class 11th when I saw or used a computer. Govt of Assam used to provide laptops for students doing well in 10th at that time. I passed my 10th in 2011 and got the laptop by Dec the same year. I was over the moon.

I was so into cricket that studies almost become secondary to me. There were few other factors also contributing to this. Being not regular to school and not being around tuition classes resulted in me getting left alone in the classes. Some teachers were even biased to students taking tuition from them. Being introvert didn't help. But I was welcomed warmly into the cricket field. I was too confined. I was limiting myself inside the cricket field. By the time I realise, I must appear my 12th, I didn't have enough time. I didn't do very well but was in the top half of the class.

During my 11th and 12th period I didn't have enough luxury to plan long, I was in a rush to get a job as I had to support my family financially sooner than later. After 12th I thought of going for Air force interviews but couldn't do it because of knocked knees (Medically unfit). I got into B.Sc. in 2013. Now, again I was splitting my energy between cricket and studies for the first two years. I was growing every day, I was getting used to reality every day. Now, I had to do a computer course as most of the govt job asks for one. I join NEILIT O level.
<!–-break-–>
 I was the best in our class. I was loving every bit of programming. I was clear what I can do If not playing cricket. I was graduated in 2016. Completed the O level in Feb or March of 2017. And joined MCA in IGNOU, as it was cheap and classes used to be only during the weekends, allowing me to work part-time if needed. I moved to Guwahati, stayed there for 1 semester. I was not happy with my progress there and decided to move to Bangalore.
<!–-break-–>
Moving to Bangalore was one of the toughest decision. Moving to Bangalore means cutting almost all the chances of getting a Govt job. But I was very clear of the importance. That helped to convince my parents and brother. They have blind trust in me. I  flew to Bangalore on 2nd of Sept 2017.

I went off-road a few times, had a few hiccups but overall I was on the track all of the time. Most importantly I knew my track. I had analysed everything and had a plan prepared. I started by looking at Software engineer job posts and slowly building up the skills, as I progress through my course.
<!–-break-–>
I started with an internship in Sept of 2018, which gave me a clear picture of realities in a software developers job. I continued in the same place for a while. Then I took a break to skill up and in Sept of 2019, I joined Radicali where I grew to lead the team within a year.
<!–-break-–>
Now after completing a year in Radicali, I feel my growth has been stuck, I am not pushed enough. Also, I would have loved to build a product which impacts people around me. Now, I am more interested in working for the people, working from home. Rapid development in my hometown means more room for entrepreneurship. I am moving to Assam, No matter what. 
<!–-break-–>
I feel like completing a circle now. From a biologist trying to be a software engineer to leading a team. I am into the next circle now. Slowly I would like to transition to a position where I can impacts more peoples live, esp. people around me. But for the immediate, I am would love to work on more challenging stuff, work with more experienced people, expand my network. Build my reputations for the next step (will share later), work on financial security.
<!–-break-–>
I have resigned from Radicali and joined a startup working in the Health sector, named OrangeHealth. With more senior people around and with a larger target audience I am expecting a huge lot of challenges in the coming days. I am joining them in the last week of Oct.
<!–-break-–>
I will be working for the community in whatever way I can along with doing a few runs a week, playing cricket and trying to invest in a few ideas in my hometown. I will take my flight back home on 13th of Oct thanking Bangalore for awesome 3 years.

Take care.
